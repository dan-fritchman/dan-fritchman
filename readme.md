I'm Dan. This is my home page. The cactus is named Dan too. He's kinda like my avatar. If you see Dan the cactus as the profile photo anywhere else, that's almost certainly me. 

### Why is your home page just like a GitHub README?

### About The Author

I've has spent most of my career designing electronics. Mostly chips. But also boards, systems, [products you'd buy](https://www.techinsights.com/blog/apple-lightning-30-pin-adapter-teardown). Most of that time was at Apple. And while I love it, I also hate it. I pretty quickly became a fairly disgruntled practitioner in those fields, par

After that I spent some time designing software for more normal people, particularly [live teaching & learning](https://medium.com/swlh/open-source-live-notebook-based-teaching-learning-41b2f7436fc3), mostly from a series of European cafes. 

And for the past few years heâ€™s worked on the research-grade versions of things like GenAlpha at UC Berkeley, receiving the PhD in late 2023. 

In late 2023 I had the convenient occassion to write down how I had spent most of the prior few years, in the form of a PhD dissertation. That is titled [An Integrated Circuit Design Framework for Human, Computer, and ML Designers](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2023/EECS-2023-275.html). People (even normal people) have read and offered glowing reviews. The source material is [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Thesis), if you prefer to read it in a format similar to this home page. And the overwhelming majority of the underlying work is in the form of open-source software, also hosted here on GitHub. 

LinkedIn says we're in stealth mode, because you guys seem to find that cool? But if you've read this long, you can be in on the secret, we're [Generation Alpha (Transistor)](https://generation-alpha-transistor.com/). If you wanna learn more [just reach out](mailto:dan@gen-alpha.io).
