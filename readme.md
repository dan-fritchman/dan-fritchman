I had recent occassion to write down most of what I had been doing for the past few years, in the form of a PhD dissertation, [An Integrated Circuit Design Framework for Human, Computer, and ML Designers](https://bit.ly/dans-phd-thesis). That includes lots of thoughts about our field, its future, and related hot takes. It has been lauded as "actually kinda good" and "not boring" and "how I (the reader) used to write before there was ChatGPT", even by non-nerds. If you are a non-nerd, I recommend the prologue and first chapter or two. (I suspect the quoted reviewers stopped there.) Only those with a shared special breed of nerdery of will care to read to the end.

## GenAlpha

LinkedIn says we're in stealth mode, because you guys seem to find that cool? But if you've read this long, you can be in on the secret, we're [Generation Alpha (Transistor)](https://generation-alpha-transistor.com/). If you wanna learn more [just reach out](mailto:dan@gen-alpha.io). 


## FAQ

Of late I have been asked with increasing frequency whether I am in fact a cactus.  
That would make this site (and especially all the work it describes) way more impressive. And the cactus is named Dan too (after someone I know). 
But no I look more like this.  
Dan the cactus (RIP) fills in as an avatar on sites like this. If you see Dan on some other site, that's probably me.

### Is this a personal web site? Or just like a GitHub README page?

It's both. 

As of this writing https://dan.fritch.mn redirects to here.  
For many years it had been a custom site, with custom styling and various build flows and languages and tools, and I got tired of it. GitHub's markdown styling and rendering works just great for stuff like this thanks.
